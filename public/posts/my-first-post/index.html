          <p>Welcome to the official site of Lazy Hound Games! You&rsquo;ve never heard of us, I guarrantee it. We&rsquo;re two brothers who work a mindless day job and make games in our spare time.</p>
<p>Who are we, and why haven&rsquo;t you hear of us? We just started trying to make games a few years back. Between kids, work, and other hobbies it&rsquo;s been hard to find the time. But we&rsquo;re serious, I tell you! It&rsquo;s gonna happen&hellip; sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Oh yeah! This site is made with Hugo - an incredible templating system for building websites fast. Check out the <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> website for more information.</p>
<p>So to the point - we&rsquo;re working on a new FPS horror game. I&rsquo;m currently writing the story and working out the base mechanics. The game idea came from one my first attempts at programming which was a text adventure game. I showed it to my partner who dubbed it &ldquo;unplayable&rdquo;. She wasn&rsquo;t wrong but it was a fun project that provided a excellent enviornment to learn C#. You can check that piece of s#%$t out here.</p>

Welcome to the official site of Lazy Hound Games! You've never heard of us, I guarrantee it. We're two brothers who work a mindless day job and make games in our spare time. 

Who are we, and why haven't you heard of us? We just started trying to make games a few years back. Between kids, work, and other hobbies it's been hard to find the time. But we're serious, I tell you! It's gonna happen... sooner rather than later.

Oh yeah! This site is made with Hugo - an incredible templating system for building websites fast. Check out the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website for more information.

So to the point - we're working on a new FPS horror game. I'm currently writing the story and working out the base mechanics. The game idea came from one my first attempts at programming which was a text-based adventure game. I showed it to my partner who dubbed it "unplayable". She wasn't wrong but it was a fun project that provided an excellent environment to learn C#.

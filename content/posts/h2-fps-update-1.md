The story for this FPS game (built in Unity... for now) is coming along nicely. Our game centers around a detective from Danvers, Massachusetts, US who has had some encounters he cannot explain. Here's a little excerpt from the story so far:</br>

```
"Morning, Bill," said Chief Irons as detective Bill Schafer walked into the office. "Got a case here that needs looking into"

Bill settled into a chair and opened the case file on the desk. "Chief, this happened in Maine. What's the connection to us?" asked Bill, frowning a little.

"It's not our ususal cup of coffee," the chief admitted leaning forward on his desk. "I happen to know these folks. Quite well, actually. Charlie and Pam Bright are close friends of mine, and their daughter, Alice, is my godchild."

"Still... wouldn't it be better for the cops up there to handle this? I mean, they'd be more familiar with the community - this Mirror Falls place. I've spent very little time in Maine." Bill was trying to be diplomatic with his boss, but he was still was wondering why he was being asked to take this particular assignment.

"I need you on this, Bill," Irons said. "Something about this doesn't feel right. And... ," the chief paused, choosing his words carefully, "you've been able to spot things that other tend to miss."

"I'm not sure what you mean..." Bill started, but the chief cut him off.

"You damn well do," said Irons fiercely. "You've got your assignment. Get going and keep me informed."

Bill stood up. He was more than a little startled by this uncharacteristic outburst.

"Sorry, Bill," said the chief. "I'm just worried. Take care of yourself out there."

"Don't worry about me, Chief," Bill said with a reasuring smile. "I'll let you know once I reach Mirror Falls." 

The chief met his eyes and nodded. Bill walked out of the office closing the door behind him. Chief Irons waited for Bill to be a few steps down the hall before picking up the phone and dialing.

"... Hello Father," said Irons. "... yes, yes. He's on his way now."

For now, the working title for the game is **The Secret**. This will definitely change as the story becomes more complete.

The plan is to take a bit a of a Madison approach where you are experiencing supernatural events as the main character and have a story that is inspired by the Conjuring movies.

The next post will have some images from the working demo so keep your eyes peeled!

-- Arrrooooo!
